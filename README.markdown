This is my site/blog made with Jekyll and octopress. Making your own repo with your username.github.io will create github pages site for you as well! It's real nifty.

### What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

### What is Octopress?

[Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) is a static blogging framework built on top of Jekyll. It uses scripts to build static files to be deployed to a server.

### Additional Credits
