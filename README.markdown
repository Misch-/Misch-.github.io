## Carlin's Website

In development, go away! :) [This is my rad site](https://misch-.github.io/) made with Jekyll and octopress.

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

## What is Octopress?

[Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) is a static blogging framework built on top of Jekyll. It uses scripts to build static files to be deployed to a server.
