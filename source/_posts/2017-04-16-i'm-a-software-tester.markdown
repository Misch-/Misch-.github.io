This post is a little belated, I've actually been working part-time at my new company, [ParityFactory](http://www.parityfactory.com/), for a few weeks now. The upside of that being, I can say for certain that I know it's real and that I'm going to be able to grow professionally within this company. The role starting out for me is pretty easy, just doing a lot of manual testing and following test plans trying to break new features developers are building into our application. It's also a totally microsoft oriented company, so I feel like I'm playing for the other team now, not to say that's a bad thing! Being unemployed was fun, but not feeling like a bum all the time is way better. I'm glad to put that source of anxiety out of my life. I'm ready to start climbing the ladder.

 Best wishes to anyone one their own job search, hang in there!
