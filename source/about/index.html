Hi! I'm Carlin! I'm {{'now' | date: "%s" | plus : 185587200 | date: "%y"}} years old. 
<br><br>
Little bio about myself; 
<br><br>
I grew up in the twin cities area of Minnesota. I've been tinkering on computers since I was a young kid, cliche, I know. Got my degree in CS at North Dakota State University. While there, I was part of a small engineering fraternity, epsilon chapter of Sigma Phi Delta. During the last two years of college, I also worked at Scheels corporate, a midwest sporting goods retailer. I updated servers by night there, learning all about Linux and system administration. I finished my degree, went full time for a bit, saved up enough to escape Fargo, ND and moved here to Seattle! The rest is still to unfold!
