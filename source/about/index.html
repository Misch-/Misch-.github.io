Hi! I'm Carlin Mische. I'm a {{'now' | date: "%s" | plus : 185587200 | date: "%y"}} year old dude from the midwest with a background in linux administration that recently started as a software tester in Seattle.
<br><br>

On my own time, I mostly enjoy meandering around the city, getting drinks, going to meetups, and generally exploring all this new stuff. The outdoorsy stereotype prevalent here suits me pretty well. I have a lot of typical nerdy interests, sci-fi books, amatuer photography, and I consume a massive amount of electronica. If that all sounded rather normal, it was intentional, I'm glad I can at least pretend.

If I can do something for you, feel free to shoot me an email!
